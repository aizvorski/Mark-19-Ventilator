Our engineering team has already drawn the Mark 7 as-built and we are open sourcing those designs. 
We plan to ship improved units by June 1, 2020. With your help, this is possible.
Friends from National Strategic Research Institute (NSRI) and UC Davis started their restless efforts to find fundings and tech supports 
for the project.  Autodesk provided collaborative CAD software for us to work with.  Among all these, a call from a stranger, 
Alex Ivzorski, borough in the help from 3D System along with Waygate Technologies to create the 3D metrology of the manifold.
